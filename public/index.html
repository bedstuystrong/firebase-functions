    <p>
      Bed-Stuy Strong is a group of neighbors helping neighbors in a spirit of solidarity. We are a mutual aid network of over
      2,800 people from across Bed-Stuy who are supporting our community during the COVID-19 crisis. We crowdsource donations
      and use them to provide no-contact grocery deliveries for vulnerable members of our Bed-Stuy communities.
    </p>
    <p>
      All of our members are ordinary folks volunteering their time and effort. We are not a government agency or a
      non-profit. You can <a href="/principles">learn more about our guiding principles here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Given the times, Bed-Stuy Strong faces an incredible amount of need in our community. Every day we receive hundreds of
      calls. We spend several thousand dollars daily to try to make sure our neighbors do not go hungry. We ask for your
      patience and support as we try to connect our community’s help to our community’s need.
    </p>
    <h2>I want to donate.</h2>
    <p>
      One hundred percent of donations to Bed-Stuy Strong are used to purchase groceries and basic supplies for vulnerable
      neighbors. Households then receive what they need from our network of delivery volunteers – ordinary Bed-Stuy residents
      who are looking to help members of their community.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are grateful for every contribution. Every dollar you give has a direct impact on the safety and well-being of our
      Bed-Stuy neighbors. In our first month of operations, Bed-Stuy Strong purchased and delivered a week’s supply of
      groceries for over 3,500 neighbors, providing an estimated 70,000 meals. 85% of the neighbors we've served are elderly,
      immunocompromised, or disabled.

    <h2>I want to help.</h2>
    <p>
      We need more neighbors to help answer our phones and run deliveries to those in need. If you’re interested in joining us, please
      fill out our <a href="/volunteer">volunteer sign up form</a> and <a href="/slack">join us on Slack</a> (you'll need to do both).
      We’re excited to have you on board.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond our mutual aid operation, our online Slack community is also a place for neighbors to connect, share information,
      organize virtual events, and more. In an age of social distancing, Bed-Stuy Strong believes in the power of staying
      connected as a community.
    </p>
    <h2>I am in need.</h2>
    <p>
      We are here to help – if you live in Bed-Stuy and are unable to afford food or basic supplies, or if you are
      immunocompromised and cannot leave home, you can reach us via text or voicemail at <a href="tel:9174515522">917-451-5522</a>.
      We’ll do our best to assist you.
    </p>
    <p>
      We answer all texts and voicemails in the order that they are received. Please do not leave multiple voicemails or
      texts. At our current rate of demand and funding, we are trying to respond to each call or text within one week. If you
      do not have a phone, you can email us at <a href="mailto:bedstuystrong@bedstuystrong.com">bedstuystrong@bedstuystrong.com</a>.
      Text or voicemail is preferred.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is such a hard time for so many. Many of our volunteers are working every day to try to help, while trying to
      provide for themselves and keep themselves safe. We ask for your patience and grace while we try to do our best, in our
      capacity as an informal network of neighbors and ordinary folk.
