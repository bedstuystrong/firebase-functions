    <p>
      Bed-Stuy Strong is a group of neighbors helping neighbors in a spirit of solidarity. We are a mutual aid network of over
      3,000 people from across Bed-Stuy who are supporting our community during the COVID-19 crisis. We crowdsource donations
      and use them to provide no-contact grocery deliveries for vulnerable members of our Bed-Stuy communities.
    </p>
    <p>
      All of our members are ordinary folks volunteering their time and effort. We are not a government agency or a
      non-profit. You can <a href="/principles">learn more about our guiding principles here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Given the times, Bed-Stuy Strong faces an incredible amount of need in our community. Every day we receive hundreds of
      calls. We spend several thousand dollars daily to try to make sure our neighbors do not go hungry. We ask for your
      patience and support as we try to connect our community’s help to our community’s need.
    </p>

      If you live in Bed-Stuy and are experiencing hunger, please leave us a voicemail or send a text message to
      <a href="tel:9174515522">917-451-5522</a>.
      We will call you back to coordinate a no-contact delivery of essential groceries or medical supplies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our thoughts are with you. We apologize that we can’t meet your request immediately. We have received thousands of
      messages and respond in the order that requests are received, so there is no need to leave multiple voicemails.

      One hundred percent of donations to Bed-Stuy Strong are used to purchase groceries and basic supplies for vulnerable
      neighbors. Households then receive what they need from our network of delivery volunteers – ordinary Bed-Stuy residents
      who are looking to help members of their community.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are grateful for every contribution. Every dollar you give has a direct impact on the safety and well-being of our
      Bed-Stuy neighbors. Since our founding in March, Bed-Stuy Strong purchased and delivered a week’s supply of
      groceries for over 8,000 neighbors, providing an estimated 200,000 meals. 85% of the neighbors we've served are elderly,
      immunocompromised, or disabled.

      As unemployment and economic hardship continues to grow due to the COVID-19 crisis, we are continuing to evolve to
      ensure we can continue supporting our neighbors in need. As part of this evolution, we are exploring potential
      partnerships with Brooklyn-based organizations and businesses that have expertise in food provision and distribution and
      access to physical space. If you’re interested in discussing partnership opportunities, please email us at
      <a href="mailto:partnerships@bedstuystrong.com">partnerships@bedstuystrong.com</a>.
