    <h1><a href="/">Bed-Stuy Strong</a></h1>
    <p>
      We are a mutual aid network of over 2,500 volunteers and neighbors from across Bed-Stuy who are supporting our community
      during the COVID-19 crisis.
    </p>
    <h2>Donate</h2>
    <p>
      One hundred percent of donations to Bed-Stuy Strong are used to purchase groceries and basic supplies for neighbors in
      need. These groceries and supplies are then dropped off by a network of hundreds of delivery volunteers – ordinary Bed
      Stuy residents who are looking to help members of their community.
    </p>
