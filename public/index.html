    <p>
      Bed-Stuy Strong is a group of neighbors helping neighbors in a spirit of solidarity. We are a mutual aid network of over
      3,000 people from across Bed-Stuy who are supporting our community during the COVID-19 crisis. We crowdsource donations
      and use them to provide no-contact grocery deliveries for vulnerable members of our Bed-Stuy communities.
    </p>
    <p>
      All of our members are ordinary folks volunteering their time and effort. We are not a government agency or a
      non-profit. You can <a href="/principles">learn more about our guiding principles here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Given the times, Bed-Stuy Strong faces an incredible amount of need in our community. Every day we receive hundreds of
      calls. We spend several thousand dollars daily to try to make sure our neighbors do not go hungry. We ask for your
      patience and support as we try to connect our community’s help to our community’s need.
    </p>

    <p>
      One hundred percent of donations to Bed-Stuy Strong are used to purchase groceries and basic supplies for vulnerable
      neighbors. Households then receive what they need from our network of delivery volunteers – ordinary Bed-Stuy residents
      who are looking to help members of their community.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are grateful for every contribution. Every dollar you give has a direct impact on the safety and well-being of our
      Bed-Stuy neighbors. In our first month of operations, Bed-Stuy Strong purchased and delivered a week’s supply of
      groceries for over 3,500 neighbors, providing an estimated 70,000 meals. 85% of the neighbors we've served are elderly,
      immunocompromised, or disabled.

    <h2 id="help">I want to help.</h2>
    <p>
      We need more neighbors to help answer our phones and run deliveries to those in need. If you’re interested in joining us, please
      fill out our <a href="/volunteer">volunteer sign up form</a> and <a href="/slack">join us on Slack</a> (you'll need to do both).
      We’re excited to have you on board.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond our mutual aid operation, our online Slack community is also a place for neighbors to connect, share information,
      organize virtual events, and more. In an age of social distancing, Bed-Stuy Strong believes in the power of staying
      connected as a community.

    <h3><u>Please note: we are temporarily paused on accepting new requests until June 3rd.</u></h3>
    <p><strong>
      We apologize that we are unable to accept new requests at this time. With our limited funds and volunteers, we are
      focused on fulfilling the high number of requests we’ve received.
    </strong></p>
    <p>
      If you called or texted us on or before May 20, we will get back to you &mdash; it's currently taking us 20 days to call people
      back. We hope to reopen our phone request line as soon as we have the resources to continue accepting delivery requests.
    </p>

    <p>
      As unemployment and economic hardship continues to grow due to the COVID-19 crisis, we are continuing to evolve to
      ensure we can continue supporting our neighbors in need. As part of this evolution, we are exploring potential
      partnerships with Brooklyn-based organizations and businesses that have expertise in food provision and distribution and
      access to physical space. If you’re interested in discussing partnership opportunities, please email us at
