    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>
      We are a mutual aid network of over 2,000 volunteers and neighbors from across Bed-Stuy who are supporting our community
      during the COVID-19 crisis. If you’re interested in joining us, please fill out our <a href="/volunteer">volunteer sign up form</a> and <a href="/slack">join us on Slack</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Our online Slack community is a place for neighbors to connect, share information, organize virtual events, and
      coordinate mutual aid efforts.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are here to help – if you are unable to afford food or basic supplies, or if you are immunocompromised and cannot
      leave home, you can reach us via text or voicemail at <a href="tel:7327719663">(732) 771-9663</a> or by email
      at <a href="mailto:bedstuystrong@bedstuystrong.com">bedstuystrong@bedstuystrong.com</a> and we will do our best to assist you.

    <h2>Donate</h2>
    <p>
      One hundred percent of donations to Bed-Stuy Strong are used to purchase groceries and basic supplies for neighbors in
      need. These groceries and supplies are then dropped off by a network of hundreds of delivery volunteers – ordinary Bed
      Stuy residents who are looking to help members of their community.
