      <p>Mutual aid is inherently political work. As the summer's uprisings bloomed in the midst of this global pandemic, it
      became ever clearer to BSS that we must continue to acknowledge the political implications of how we exist, of what (and
      who) we organize for. In the spring, we collectively adopted our <a href="/principles">guiding principles</a>. In last 
      month&rsquo;s <a
          href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1TWUWIDVuCWkhyEh9evMsC-qq7dnXLfWhxBB_i1PV9Ps/edit#slide=id.p"
          target="_blank" rel="noopener">all
          hands</a>, we specifically focused on <a
          href="/political-commitments"
          target="_blank" rel="noopener">BSS&rsquo;s
          Political Positions and Actions</a>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>We want every neighbor in Bed-Stuy to have their survival needs met. </strong></li>
        <li><strong>We believe resistance is a human right and a communal necessity. </strong></li>
        <li><strong>We believe in the power of individual voices and support local engagement. </strong></li>
        <li><strong>We believe in wealth sharing and redistribution. </strong></li>
        <li><strong>We believe in the necessity of political education. </strong></li>
        <li><strong>We want community alternatives to policing.</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <p><a href="/political-commitments" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This document</a> articulates the political 
        commitments and investments that have developed in the early stages (first seven months) of BSS, which are 
        embodied and exemplified by the work of our members. </p>
      <p><strong>As a member of this community, consider meditating on these positions and ask yourself what they mean
          to you in the context of the upcoming election.</strong></p>

        <li>Do you see yourself and your needs in these political commitments? </li>
        <ul>
          <li>If not, what / who is missing? </li>
          <li>If so, how do you / will you support these political actions?</li>
        </ul>
        <li>As we continue to define what it means to be a BSS member, are there personal political commitments that we
          might ask of folk?</li>
        <li>How do we hold ourselves accountable to these political commitments? </li>

      <p>One final note of reflection. Electoral politics is one, imperfect, essential tool from the toolbox of change.
        Movements, direct action, anticapitalist practices like mutual aid, and cultural reckonings are engines of liberation
        and social change. Winning elections can help us enshrine that change. It can help ensure we have winnable targets in
        office to enact that change in legislation and policy. If voting did not matter, we would not have egregious
        gerrymandering and voter suppression all throughout this country targeting Black, brown, and poor people. In this
        moment, it is not enough only to vote. But it's a start. Let's go.</p>

      <h3 id="register">URGENT: REGISTRATION</h3>
      <p><strong>What to know: </strong>You must be registered to vote <strong>BEFORE OCTOBER 9TH</strong> to vote in
        this election. <strong>October 14th</strong> was your last day to submit a change of address form. Call 1-866-VOTE-NYC
        or <a href="http://vote.org/register-to-vote/new-york" target="_blank" rel="noopener">go online</a> to request a
        voter registration form. BK Voter Alliance suggests that volunteers<em> physically drop off their registration forms at the BOE.</em></p>
      <p><strong>What to do: </strong>Still need to register? <strong><a href="http://www.vote.org/" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener">Do it
            now.</a></strong>
        Think you&rsquo;re already registered? Even if you&rsquo;ve already checked your status, <strong><a
            href="https://tvote.org/2FGrmZr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">check again</a></strong>. Make sure your
        registration matches your current address and that your status is "Active".</p>

      <h3 id="vote">HOW TO VOTE</h3>
      <h4 id="vote-by-mail">VOTING OPTION 01: VOTE BY MAIL / ABSENTEE BALLOT</h4>
      <p><strong>What to know: </strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>There is risk attached to mail-in voting this year. Our administration has been working to defund the USPS
          all while undermining the integrity of mail-in ballots through false claims of voter fraud.</li>
        <li>Even in the best of circumstances, mail-in votes are counted after in-person votes. Votes cast in person
          during early voting or on Election Day will be counted faster, and thus have a higher impact on the way election
          results look early on. </li>
        <li>If you cannot pick up your absentee ballot, or will not be able to receive it through the mail, you have the
          right to designate someone to pick it up for you. Only the person designated on your application may pick up and
          deliver your ballot.</li>
        <li>Your ballot must match your voter registration info <em>exactly</em>. 100,000 Brooklyn residents received a
          mismatched ballot in the mail this past month. If you are one of those people, the BOE will be sending out new
          absentee ballots immediately. You do NOT need to request a new ballot. </li>
        <li>If you or someone you know is currently unhoused you can still vote. Your place of residence can be wherever you reside,
            including shelters, and your address where you receive mail can be with a friend or at a P.O. Box.</li>
        <li>In New York, you may mark &ldquo;temporarily disabled&rdquo; and it serves as a valid excuse for those who
          are homebound due to COVID-19. </li>
        <li>Absentee ballots need stamps, and that <a
            href="https://gothamist.com/news/new-yorkers-heres-how-vote-2020-election" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener">stamp rate can vary</a>. If your
          ballot is <em>not pre-paid</em>, put two stamps before sending it to be safe.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>What to do: </strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>If you need to vote by mail, <strong><a href="https://tvote.org/3hNHuHQ" target="_blank"
              rel="noopener">request your absentee
              ballot</a></strong>
          ASAP. The deadline for this is <strong>October 27</strong>, but be warned that despite this deadline, the Post
          Office has advised they cannot guarantee timely delivery of ballots applied for less than 15 days before an
          election.</li>
        <li>Take a screenshot/photo of the tracking code at the end of your ballot before you send it off, in case you
          need
          it.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Date Details:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>October 27th:</strong> Last day to apply online, by email, fax or to
          postmark an application or letter of application by mail for an absentee ballot. <strong>
            Important: because of USPS delays, the effective deadline was 2 weeks before, around October 10th.
          </strong></li>
        <li><strong>November 2nd:</strong> Last day to apply IN-PERSON for absentee ballot.</li>
        <li><strong>November 3rd:</strong> Last day your absentee ballot can be postmarked. Must be received by your
          Board of Elections no later than Nov. 10th. Military Voter Ballots must be received no later than Nov. 16th.</li>
        <li><strong>November 3rd:</strong> Last day to drop ballot off IN-PERSON to the local Board of Elections or to
          any polling place. </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Ballot Casting Details:</strong></p>
      <p>There are several ways you can cast your completed, signed absentee ballot:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Put it in the mail ensuring it receives a postmark no later than November 3</li>
        <li>Drop it off at an Early Voting poll site between October 24 and November 1</li>
        <li>Drop it off at a poll site on November 3 by 9pm</li>
        <li>Drop it off at your county Board of Elections Office starting September 8 through no later than November 3
          by 9pm (list of county Boards of Elections Offices <a

      <h4 id="vote-early">VOTING OPTION 02: VOTE EARLY (IN PERSON) <em class="highlight">ENCOURAGED</em></h4>
      <p><strong>What to know: </strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>This is the FIRST presidential election where New Yorkers have early voting &mdash; a major victory for our
          state.
          <strong>It begins in our city for registered voters on </strong><strong>Saturday, October
            24th and ends on November 1st.</strong></li>
        <li>You can <strong>always</strong> go vote in person early, even if you requested an absentee ballot, and
          <em>even if you already sent one in</em>. The in person vote overrides the absentee ballot.</li>
        <li>If you feel safe and able to vote early in person, we recommend you treat it like a masked trip to the
          supermarket
          and <strong>do it.</strong> This is the most powerful way to cast your vote this year, since not every polling
          place will be full all the time. You may wonder, "Why should I do this? I&rsquo;m not in a swing state?" It matters
          for three reasons:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>In-person votes are counted first and will get us closer to a definitive count on Election Day itself.
            Because of COVID-19, many folks who <em>must </em>be homebound are absentee voting from all over the country,
            putting stress on the postal system and the ability to call a clear victory. </li>
          <li>Voting in person <em>before </em>Election Day means you alleviate lines for others on Election Day, which
            helps with COVID-19 concerns. </li>
          <li>Even if we live in an Electoral College system and New York is likely to go blue, the Popular Vote matters, as does
          every factor that points towards a clear loss for the current administration’s ticket.</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>What to do: </strong><a href="https://www.voteearlyny.org/#!Brooklyn" target="_blank"
          rel="noopener">Look up your nearest early voting
          location</a> (likely to be different from your Election Day site), and make a plan to go during the 9-day
        early voting period (<a href="https://www.vote.nyc/page/early-voting-information" target="_blank"
          rel="noopener">opening hours here</a>). </p>
      <h4 id="vote-election-day">VOTING OPTION 03: VOTE ON ELECTION DAY (IN-PERSON)</h4>
      <p><strong>What to know: </strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The General Election is </strong><strong>Tuesday, November 3.</strong></li>
        <li>It&rsquo;s gonna be a long, chaotic day! If applicable to you and your current situation, organize with your
          co-workers to encourage your company to <a href="https://www.maketimetovote.org/" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener">make election day a paid day off.</a></li>
        <li>As long as you&rsquo;re in line by 8:59 pm, you can vote. Don't let anyone turn you away, even if there's a
          line. We encourage those who are able to do line support. Foldable chairs, food, water, snacks and PPE at polling locations
          can really make a difference.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>What to do:</strong> <a href="https://findmypollsite.vote.nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Make
          sure you know your polling place</a>. Mask up, bring snacks, and grab your voter registration card if you got
          one (it'll speed things up)!</p>

      <h3 id="key-races">WHO ARE WE VOTING FOR? KEY RACES &amp; CANDIDATES</h3>
      <p>This next election is not just for president, it's also for lots of other elected positions at the city and
        state level. In June, during the Democratic Primaries, we elected many progressive people for local positions. Since
        we vote so Democratic In New York, the primaries basically served as the election itself BUT to officially get these
        folks into office, we <strong><em>still need to vote them in for the General Election</em></strong>. Especially if the
        top of the ticket doesn't inspire you, find someone who does get you excited for a better future! Vote for amazing
        people like Phara Souffrant Forest and AOC. </p>
      <p><strong class="highlight">Important note:</strong> Multiple BSS organizers who can vote will be voting for the presidential candidates on the Working
      Families Party line. WFP — which has helped move the state in a progressive direction and been a bulwark against
      pro-capital interests — is under threat by a controversial new law. Here is a CNN piece explaining some of the
      background. To quote Tiffany Caban, "the guarantee of the WFP's presence on the ballot is important because it offers an
      on-ramp to candidates without traditional resumes or political connections to run for office and, when its votes are
      counted, provides clear evidence of the progressive movement's support to Democratic officials."</p>

        <li>Check the candidate's website, social media, and endorsements (we're looking for specific policy
          commitments, not vague promises of change). We also love good communications! Look for videos of them on IG and YouTube, see if
          what they say makes sense and if it matches up with the actions you want them to take. If they held office before,
          check their voting records. </li>

      <h3 id="what-were-doing">WHAT BED-STUY STRONG IS DOING</h3>
      <p>Bed-Stuy&rsquo;s voter turnout rates in 2016 were ~39%, compared to 53% nationally. Here&rsquo;s what
        we&rsquo;re
        doing to get that number up in 2020:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Postmarked envelopes</strong> with voter registration forms have been integrated in bulk deliveries
          for the past few weekends.</li>
        <li><strong>Intake scripts</strong> have been updated with key information for those who reach out to the BSS
          hotline.
        </li>
        <li>We&rsquo;re running a <strong>mass texting program</strong> with pertinent voter information,
          like the key dates and recommendations from this guide, as well as new laws and suppression efforts to be aware of.
        </li>
        <li>A number of BSS members are being <strong>trained as Poll Workers</strong>, and plan to keep BSS apprised of
          any potential issues on the day, so that we can generate awareness in our community</li>
        <li>We&rsquo;re looking into <strong>retrieving and delivering ballots</strong> on behalf of neighbors, which if we move 
          ahead will require deep mutual trust and accountability since voters must name the person who will pick up and deliver their ballot.
        </li>
        <li>We ask that BSS members step up if they feel comfortable <strong>driving neighbors to the polls</strong> or
          <strong>acting as community placeholders for older members</strong> (assuming there will be lines). Join us in
          <strong><a href="https://bedstuystrong.slack.com/archives/C01BU3K7UDD" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#politics-in-action</a> </strong>and let us know if this is something you want to do. If there&rsquo;s
          enough interest, we&rsquo;ll look to formalize these initiatives. </li>
        <li>We'll also be popping up around the neighborhood handing out stamps for absentee ballots, helping voters find their
          early polling site, and answering questions about voting.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4 id="poll-working-caretaking">POLL WORKING AND CARETAKING</h4>
      <p>If you're young, not at major COVID risk and you have a flexible schedule, sign up to be a poll worker! There
        is a steep shortage of poll workers nation-wide and most who&rsquo;ve done this work in the past are over 60 years
        old. One of the best ways you can exercise your civic engagement is to relieve these folks of their post and fuel the new
        generation. <a href="https://nyc.electiondayworker.com/recruitment" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Power The Polls</a> has all the info!</p>
      <p><strong>What to know: </strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>If you apply you may not get approved &mdash; but you probably will!</li>
        <li>The work is <strong>paid</strong>.</li>
        <li>There&rsquo;s a 4-hour training and an easy 20-question, open book quiz</li>
        <li>You&rsquo;ll be assigned to a polling place within your county, which may not be near your own polling
          place! </li>
        <li>On the day, you&rsquo;ll need to get to your assigned polling site by 5am and will probably be there past 10pm. 
          You get two 1-hour breaks to take before 6pm. BYO food &amp; drinks!</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If this isn&rsquo;t for you, consider furnishing a polling place line with supplies like snacks, PPE, folding chairs, water or

      <p>Phone bank with <a href="https://swingleft.org/p/phone-bank" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Swing Left</a> for
        Democratic candidates in Arizona,

      <p>
        The electorate has been overwhelmed with calls and texts this season, and most letter-writing initiatives are wrapping
        up. But <a href="https://votefwd.org/bigsend/swingleft" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vote Forward&rsquo;s The Big Send.</a> is
        still going! Write and send a postcard (or 100) to a fellow American.</p>
      <p>Lastly, pressure officials to strengthen voting processes, expand accessibility and so much more by supporting
        and joining organizations like <a href="https://letnyvote.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Let NY
