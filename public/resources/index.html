    <h4>NYC Food Delivery Assistance</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>The City of New York is providing assistance to New Yorkers during the
        COVID-19 crisis by delivering free meals to those who cannot access food themselves. This service is intended
        for individuals and families who meet all of the following criteria as a result of the COVID-19
        emergency:</li>
      <li>No members of the household can go out and get food because they are at
        increased medical risk or homebound</li>
      <li>No neighbors or family members can go out and get food for you
      </li>
      <li>Do not receive meal assistance from other providers (incl. Meals on
        Wheels or God's Love We Deliver); and</li>
      <li>You are unable to afford meal delivery or grocery delivery</li>
      <li>Households that qualify may order three days of food at a time for up
        to a month. All orders will be delivered within three days of the order date. Each delivery will contain three
        days of food (9 meals per person, but no household will receive more than 18 meals per delivery).</li>
      <li>To access, create an account at this website: <a
