Hi {{firstName}}!

Thank you again for volunteering to help our neighbors.

**We've assigned you Route {{routeName}} with the following tickets. We've
listed your tickets in delivery order: {{ticketIDs}}**

**Please arrive at Brooklyn Packers this Saturday, {{deliveryDateString}} at
{{arrivalTime}} with your custom items already purchased.**

Check out the instructions below. If any issues come up day-of, contact this
week's Dispatcher: Annika at {{warehouseCoordinatorPhone1}}.

### Saturday Volunteer Instructions

- [ ] **Get ready.** Please bring a pen or marker to the store for labeling
      bags. We also recommend printing this if you canâ€”it helps to mark off
      tasks as they are completed.
- [ ] **Go shopping for custom items.** See the Custom Item Shopping List below
      for what to purchase. Sort the items into bags by household, and label
      each bag with the corresponding ticket ID. (They can all be purchased on
      one receipt).
- [ ] **Come to the Brooklyn Packers warehouse for pre-packed groceries at
      {{arrivalTime}}:** [221 Glenmore Ave, Gate 3, Brooklyn, NY
      11207]({{{warehouseMapsUrl}}})
      - [ ] Find a spot to park (please do not park in front of the main driveway).
      - [ ] Come to the warehouse and let us know you've arrived; the on-site
            coordinator will give additional information and answer any questions
            you might have.
      - [ ] Hold tight - we'll let you know when your items are ready.
- [ ] **While you're waiting,** call the recipients of each ticket to confirm
      that someone will be home to accept the delivery. **If you can't reach
      them,** let the dispatcher know and proceed with delivery. **If you reach
      them but they won't be home,** let the dispatcher know and we will use
      their groceries for someone else and deliver to them another time.
- [ ] **When your items are ready,** pull up closer and we'll bring the pallet
      to your car. You'll be given the following for each ticket (these are
      provided at the warehouse and do not need to be purchased):
      - [ ] Pre-packed groceries (may be multiple bags or boxes per household)
      - [ ] Cleaning supplies
      - [ ] Perishables bag
      - [ ] Warehouse Specialty Items (e.g. Art kits, books, etc.)
      - [ ] Water
- [ ] **Please confirm that the ticket IDs on every box and bag match your route
      number/name.**
- [ ] **Load up your car.** We recommend arranging them by route, so the first
      stop is the most accessible.
- [ ] **Make your deliveries and check off each one as you complete it.** If a
      neighbor gives you a donation, please accept it with gratitude! You can
      enter the donation amount in the delivery completion form.
- [ ] **When you're done, fill out the [Delivery Completion
      Form](https://airtable.com/shrvHf4k5lRo0I8F4).** Please include:
      - [ ] The total amount you spent
      - [ ] Images of your receipt(s)
      - [ ] A note that your reimbursement form is for **custom items shopping for
            bulk purchasing households on {{deliveryDateString}}**

Thank you!
